# Assignment(2) Project idea : Machine Learning-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

# Problem 
Cybersecurity is a major concern due to the increasing number of cyberattacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems rely on signature-based techniques and struggle to detect new or unknown attacks. This project aims to apply Machine Learning techniques to improve intrusion detection in network environments.

# Dataset
The project uses the NSL-KDD dataset which is a benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection research. The dataset contains network traffic records labeled as normal or attack categories.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and prepare it for building a multi-class classification model that can distinguish between normal traffic and different types of cyberattacks.
